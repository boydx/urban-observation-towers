          The digital surface model (DSM) was calculated using the highest first-return in a 2-foot resolution raster.
          The DSM was converted to a RGB terrain model showing surface elevations encoded as colors. The encoding is
        <pre>e = (r * 256) + g + (b / 256)</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          This encoding works for Lexington's range of surface elevations, has a sub-inch precision, and can be
          interpreted by MapLibre as a ground
          surface on which to drape features. A shaded relief map of the DSM with tree canopy cover height is the
          default base map. In terrain mode, the map becomes a 3D surface showing relative heights of features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Height is calculated by subtracting the elevation of the DSM from the elevation of the digital elevation model
          (DEM) maintained on kyraster.ky.gov. The DEM is a 2-foot resolution raster that models bare-earth ground
          elevation. Discrepancies between observed
          and sampled heights can occur from DEM interpolation in large areas where above-ground features were removed
          and DSM artifacts and noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subtract one floor when estimating observation tower heights by counting floors. The ground floor is counted
          as the first floor. Some towers have additional floors above the highest observation deck.
