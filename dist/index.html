        <p>
          The digital surface model (DSM) was calculated using the highest first-return in a 2-foot resolution raster.
          The DSM was converted to a RGB terrain model showing surface elevations encoded as colors. The encoding is
        <pre>e = (r * 256) + g + (b / 256)</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          This encoding works for Lexington's range of surface elevations, has a sub-inch precision, and can be
          interpreted by MapLibre as a ground
          surface on which to drape features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Height is calculated by subtracting the elevation of the DSM from the elevation of the digital elevation model
          (DEM) maintained on kyraster.ky.gov. The DEM is a 2-foot resolution raster. Discrepancies in observed height
          versus sampled height can occur from the DEM and DSM interpolation methods. Example: Some tower heights do not
          agree with the number of floors in the tower - and how I counted the number of floors.
